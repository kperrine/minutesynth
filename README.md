This is a small-scale front-end for working with the WebAudio library found in modern web browsers. The motivation for creating this was to leverage the powerful features of WebAudio in a form that was somewhat more compact than WebAudio itself could offer. It was used in a couple of 64K JavaScript demo projects. The pluggable design was helpful for tinkering with sounds. The library's terseness helped in whipping up code quickly and estimating final code size. After minifying, it was remarkably small.

The .js can be included in a project and immediately used. The "recorder.html" file allows for immediate synth editing and raw audio file recording. A number of demos are provided.
